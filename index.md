Our team at Razer Cars needs to know what cars we have available for rent at our store.
We need to be able to see how many of a single car type are out for rent vs on the lot.
We also need to be able to see when the cars were rented
and should be able to manage checkouts and returns from a single screen.

> **NOTE** this software is only meant to track the current status of an entire fleet of cars of a single type, not an individual car.
So when an employee signs out a 2015 Ford F150, that is not tied to any single car, instead it is just a record of any F150 being checked out.

## Project Schedule

With the upcoming holidays and rental rush coming in quick, we need to get our app up and running ASAP.
We have a few deadlines so that we can get things ready:

* Monday 1PM CST - **NEEDED** Database Model Names (the Ops/DBA is headed out and needs to get the SQL database running)
* Monday 5PM CST - **NEEDED** Users can login
* Tuesday 1PM CST - **NEEDED** Users can manage different car types (our data entry team needs to get working)
* Tuesday 5PM CST - **NEEDED** Users can manage new rentals (Checking out and returning cars)

## Design

While our designer originally was planning to use bootstrap, you and your team can use any library (Materialize, Material Lite, Foundation, etc) to create the product.
In this instance functionality is more important than pixel accuracy.

## User Features

The different screens and user features have been further broken down into their own outlines:

* [Login](general/login.html)
* [Navigation](general/navigation.html)
* [Car Type List](car-type/list.html)
* [Car Type Form](car-type/form.html)
* [Main Inventory Screen](inventory/list.html)
* [Main Inventory Details](inventory/details.html)

## Trello

If you would like to use a Trello board to keep track of your progress, below is a link to an example board with the user stories listed out.
